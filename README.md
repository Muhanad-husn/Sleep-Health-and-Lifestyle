### üîç **Scenario: Automatically identify potential sleep disorders**

This scenario helps you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio.

Background: You work for a health insurance company and are tasked to identify whether or not a potential client is likely to have a sleep disorder. The company wants to use this information to determine the premium they want the client to pay.

**Objective**: Construct a classifier to predict the presence of a sleep disorder based on the other columns in the dataset.
